# Celestial Sentinel DAO: Funding Cosmic Resilience

## Introduction
The Celestial Sentinel DAO is a visionary project aimed at protecting Earth from cosmic threats through innovation and collaboration. As a decentralized autonomous organization, we unite individuals passionate about planetary defense and sustainability.

## Mission
Our mission is to safeguard our planet from potential cosmic hazards such as asteroids and comets by pooling resources and funding projects that promote Earth's resilience.

## How It Works
Members of the DAO, known as "Cosmics," contribute to the CosmicDAO fund. These funds are then allocated to various initiatives, including tech investments, art/fashion projects, and global issue campaigns.

## Technology
We utilize blockchain technology and the Hedera network's native cryptocurrency, HBAR, to manage transactions and support our cause efficiently.

## Achievements
- Established a community of forward-thinking individuals committed to planetary defense.
- Successfully pooled resources to fund initiatives addressing cosmic threats.

## Governance
We are continuously enhancing our governance model to ensure inclusivity and effective decision-making.
